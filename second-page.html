<h2 class="text-xl text-center bg-purple-100"> Background:</h2>

    There are multiple types of paper clips out there, but one example of a paper clip is the jumbo paper clip, as the name states, it is a much larger version of the regular paper clip.
    <br> 
    Thees paper clips are used for much larger stacks of paper unlike the normal paper clip, as if you have used a normal paper clip you would have to spit the stack into different piles of paper which can lead to accidentally mis-labeling one pile, so it's better to keep a jumbo paper clip to ensure this doesn't happen.

    As you can see these are Jumbo paper clips and they are noticeably larger, as well as being thicker in width, which means it's much bettersuited for heavy duty use, and despite being called paper clips, they can be used for non-paper clips uses such as a bookmark.
    <br>
    also the jumbo paper clip shown in the image shows that they are smooth paper clips, which means as a downside it can slide off of stack of paper because it is a smooth finish paper clip.
