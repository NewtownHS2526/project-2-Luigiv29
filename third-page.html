<h2 class="text-2xl text-center text-green-900 bg-purple-100 font-bold"> Background</h2>
<p class="text-xl text-center bg-green-100">Non-Skid paper clips are the paper clips in which you can rely on to not slide off your stack of papers and they go every where on the floor.
 <br> nobody wants all their work, drawings, or whatever else you can write or print down on paper, all over the floor, but you wouldn't want your paper clip to slide off mid-walk, so you need a non-skid paper clip
 <br>as the name states, these paper clips just don't slide off, well as easily, as they have Ridges! The ridges increase the grip strength of the paper clip so now they won't just slid off on their own, now you would have to physically push them off.
